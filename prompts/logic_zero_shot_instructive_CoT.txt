Solve the following problem using explicit reasoning. Follow each step precisely before moving to the next

**Problem:**  
Alice, Bob, and Charlie are participating in a running race. The following conditions apply:  
1. Alice finished ahead of Bob.  
2. Bob finished ahead of Charlie.  
3. Charlie says he was not last.


**Steps:**  

1. **State the conditions explicitly:**  
   Write down the conditions in terms of the participants' rankings.

2. **Determine the logical ranking order:**  
   Use the conditions to deduce the complete order of the participants.

3. **Interpret Charlie's statement:**  
   - What does it mean for Charlie to "not be last"?  
   - Compare the ranking order to Charlie's claim.

4. **Conclude whether Charlie's statement is true or false:**  
   - Is Charlie's claim consistent with the ranking order?
